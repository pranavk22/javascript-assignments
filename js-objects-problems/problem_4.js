// Make a variable whose value is an object with firstName and lastName properties, but donâ€™t define
// a Person class first. Try looking up the first and last names. Try changing the last name. It seems
// very odd to Java programmers to make an object without first defining a class, but JavaScript programmers do this sort of thing all the time

// Creating object without class
let person = {
    firstName: 'Pranav',
    lastName: 'Karmarkar'
}

// Displaying first name
console.log('First Name: ' + person.firstName);

person.firstName = 'Someone else'
// Displaying updated name
console.log('First Name: ' + person.firstName);
