// Assuming that the Rectangle constructor takes a width and a height, why does the following output
// 20 instead of 200? (Hint: if you see an answer that seems too obvious to be what I am looking for,
// it probably is the answer I am looking for.)
// Rectangle r = new Rectangle(4, 5);
// r.hieght = 50;
// r.getArea(); --> 20 // Not 200

// ************
// Answer: Because the spelling of height is wrong
